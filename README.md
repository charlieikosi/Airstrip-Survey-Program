# Intent

### *Overview*
Papua New Guinea, a small Island nation situated north of Australia and borders Indonesia has so many small airports that serve much of the population in remote parts of the country. These small aerodromes, termed airstrips have surfaces that are either gravel or grass covered and are usually built into the side of mountains or in the middle of a rainforest. Survey teams that go out to these places survey them using sheets of paper in which the surveyor fills out manually by hand during the airstrip inspection. The parameters of inspection are:
1.	length, width and slope
2.	airstrip gps location
3.	surface type (gravel, grass, sealed, dirt)
4.	surface condition (wet, dry, flooded, soaked)
5.	visual aids for navigation
6.	obstacle limitation surface

This was rather tedious and papers get smudged or are either blown by wind when not bounded to a clipboard, resulting in a less efficient workflow. These data are then entered into a word file template which results in duplication of work. How can this workflow be made efficient for the surveyor in the field and avoid duplicating this in the office when transferring the data into the database? Can this process be digitized by an application that can work offline and the data stored on a local device?

### *Aim*
This project endeavours to eliminate paper entry of survey data by creating a graphical user interface (GUI) where field data is captured instantly and stored as a csv or excel file which can than be used in other data manipulations for GIS vector file creation.

# The Program
The Airstrip Survey program (see figure attached) is a user-friendly interface that shows 8 variables which guides the user to input airstrip survey data. The program also has three buttons placed at the bottom which are “Add”, “Export to Excel” and “Export to CSV”.  These buttons allow the user to retrieve the data from the program or add to it.
